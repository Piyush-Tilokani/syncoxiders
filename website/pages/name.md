# What's with the name

`SyncOxiders` :) Well:
- in Rust community the term `oxide` or `oxidize` it's often used, as it relates to `rust` as a substance
- `rs` it's short from `rust`
- many Rust related domains tend to be `.rs`

So the name is `Sync` obvious, `Oxide` as mentioned before and `rs` for the domain. So we have the website [syncoxide.rs](https://syncoxide.rs/)
