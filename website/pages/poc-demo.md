# How it works for now

**`One-way` sync:**
- have 2 mounted folders with rclone (`src`, `dst`)
- build changes tree for `src`
- apply changes from `src` to `dst` for these operations:
    - `Add`, `Modify`, `Delete`, `Rename`
- make sure changes are reflected in `dst` remote

**We use git to catch changes, how it works:**
- we keep a git repo for the folder in a `repo` folder
- we have 2 special directories for src and dst
    - `mnt`: where the actual files are
    - `repo`: the git repo that must persist between runs
- inside the `repo` we create a `tree` directory and create the tree structure from `mnt`
- in the files content we keep the `size`, `mtime` and a `MD5 hash` of the content of the file, if we use `--checksum` param on run, see below. Please not it's considerably slower with this enabled
- we do `git add .`
- then `git status -s` shows what's changed, we use `git2` crate to interact with git
- after we have the changes tree we apply them to `dst` `mnt`
    - in `Add/Modify` we check if the file in `dst` is the same as in `src` we skip it
    - comparation between the files is made using `size`, `atime`, `mtime` and `hash`, if present
    - on `Rename` if the `old` file is not present in the `dst` to move it, we copy from `src`

# Using CLI

You can run `syncoxiders -h` to see all args. The basic usage is like this:

```bash
syncoxiders --src-mnt <SRC-MNT> --src-repo <SRC-REPO> --dst-mnt <DST-MNT> --src-repo <DST-REPO>
```

By default it detects changes in files based on `size` and `mtime`. After copying to `dst` it will set also `atime` and `mtime` for the files.

Other args:
- `--dry-run`: it will not youch any files, it will just print the operations
- `--checksum`: (disabled by default): If specified it will calculate `MD5` for each file and keep it in the git repo files. It will participate in detecting changes along with `size` and `mtime`. **Please note, it will be much slower when activated.**
- `--no-crc`: (disabled by default): If specified it will skip checking `CRC` after file was transfered. Normally it compare `CRC` of file in `src` before coping and the file in `dst` after copying, this ensures the transfer was ok. **Checking `CRC` is mostly useful if disk is accessed over the network.`

# Work in progress

- have 2 mounted folders with rclone (`src`, `dst`)
- build changes tree for both of them
- merge changes trees and resolve conflicts
- apply changes to both `src` and `dst`
- make sure changes are reflected on both sremotes
