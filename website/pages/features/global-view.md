# Global view from all providers and local files, My Drive, Computers, Shared, Shared with me, Recents, Starred, Trash

Like local views but gives you an overview of files from all providers and local folders accessed based on some basic categories. Corresponds to All folder in the above diagram. You can perform all operations on them, create new files, copy between them, share, search, ...

There is one more special folder, Shared with me at the root level, where you can keep files that are shared with you which you don’t want to add to a provider or save locally. This is accessible only from our apps and when you go there you see latest version of those files and any changes you and others make will be synced between all of you.
