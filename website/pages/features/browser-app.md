# Browser app built in WebAssembly

We have a browser app as a file manager built in WebAssembly that is compatible with all major browsers. You can perform all operations from it and it handles the traffic also. Concurrent and resumable transfers.

It supports notifications that you receive for several events and changes, like when someone is sharing a file with you, someone accepted your share, someone changed a shared file and others.
